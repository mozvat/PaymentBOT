{"name":"Raspberrypi","tagline":"RaspberryPI and Payments","body":"This is a fun research and development project developing concepts around hardware and software solutions within the payments technology industry. I decided to make a mini-POS that accepts encrypted magnetic data with a $35 chip set, RaspberryPI http://www.raspberrypi.org/ using a flavor of Linux, Debian.

Mixing newer but older technologies has been a blast!!\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@mozvat\r\n---\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
