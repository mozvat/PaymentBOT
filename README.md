RaspberryPI
===========

Researching and developing concepts around hardware and software solutions 
within the payments technology industry. 


I decided to make a mini-POS that accepts encrypted magnetic data with 
a $35 chip set, RaspberryPI http://www.raspberrypi.org/ using a flavor 
of Linux, Debian. Then requests an authorization-for-payment from processors 
with a 'twist'. 


This project has been the most exciting personal R&amp;D projects!! Mixing 
newer but older technologies has been a blast!!

My technology stack:
-------------------

1) Raspberry PI  
 
2) Debian OS  

3) Python IDLE  
 
4) Python 2.7.5  
 
5) NoseTests Library for unit testing  

6) Requests HTTPLibrary  

7) JSON Library  
 
8) GitHub  
 
9) Web hooked with Travis.CI
